# Sample Application with Postgres Backend

This is a sample app to showcase use of Postgres database deployed by Nutanix.

All ideas are from this [blog post](https://www.datagraphi.com/blog/post/2021/2/10/kubernetes-guide-deploying-a-machine-learning-app-built-with-django-react-and-postgresql-using-kubernetes)

We just modified some parts of yaml, some docker repos, Ingress and OpenShift routes to deploy on Openshift on Nutanix.
